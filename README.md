# ai-rag-document-qa
This repository contains a basic implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that answers questions based on the content of a specific document. The notebook demonstrates how to load a text file, use Groq as inference engine and Mixtral as LLM, and integrate LangChain for document processing and question-answering.
